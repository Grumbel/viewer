3D Model Viewer
===============

This repository is a messy collection of 3D programming experiments.
It contains a Blender export script for 3D models along with a viewer
and a tiny 3D engine. It also contains some support for the Cybermaxx VR
headset as well as anaglyph 3D glasses.

A video of the thing in action is available at:
